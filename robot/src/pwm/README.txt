PWM library for use with PWM.v.

Initialie the PWM instance wth PWM_init.

Set the PWM period clock cycle count with PWM_set_period_cc.

Set the PWM pulse width clock cycle count with PWM_set_pulse_width_cc.

Set the PWM period and pusle width clock cycle count simultaneously with PWM_set_cc.

Set the PWM period frequency in hz with PWM_set_period_freq.

Set the PWM duty cycle as a percentage of the period with PWM_set_duty_cycle. Valid input is a double between 0.0 and 1.0.

Set the PWM period frequency in hz and the duty cycle as a percentage of the period simultaneously with PWM_set.
